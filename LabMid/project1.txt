Project Name: Library Management System

Description: 
The Library Management System is a software application designed to manage library operations efficiently. It allows librarians to manage books, track borrowings, return books, and handle membership details. The system has both admin and user roles, with admins having the ability to add, update, or delete book records. Users can browse books, check availability, and borrow or reserve books.

Technologies Used: 
- Java
- MySQL for database management
- Java Swing for the graphical user interface

Challenges Faced:
One of the primary challenges was implementing the role-based access system for admins and users while maintaining database integrity.

Key Learnings:
This project strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming principles and database design.
