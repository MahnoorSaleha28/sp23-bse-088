Project Name: E-Commerce Website

Description: 
This project is an online shopping platform that allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and complete purchases. The admin panel allows store owners to manage product listings, view sales reports, and monitor inventory levels. The website includes user registration, login functionality, and a checkout process with payment integration.

Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development
- PHP for server-side logic
- MySQL for database management

Challenges Faced:
The biggest challenge was implementing a secure payment gateway and managing the various states of an order (e.g., placed, shipped, delivered).

Key Learnings:
This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of full-stack development, particularly focusing on session management and secure transactions.
