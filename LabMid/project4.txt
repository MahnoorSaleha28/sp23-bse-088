Project Name: Health & Fitness Mobile App

Description: 
This mobile application helps users track their daily physical activities, monitor diet, and set fitness goals. The app features a dashboard to log workouts, track calories, and view progress charts. Users can also connect with friends to share goals and achievements. The app integrates with Google Fit for tracking physical activity data from wearable devices.

Technologies Used:
- React Native for mobile app development
- Firebase for real-time database and authentication
- RESTful API integration with third-party services like Google Fit

Challenges Faced:
Developing the integration with Google Fit APIs was challenging, especially managing the real-time sync of fitness data across different devices.

Key Learnings:
This project allowed me to explore mobile app development with React Native, and I gained experience working with RESTful APIs and Firebase for real-time updates.
